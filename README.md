## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM

### What I learned

Since it seems that this is a fairly simple layout, I wanted to see how comfortable I am with coding a single component. I am getting little faster in thinking of the structure of the html while looking at the design.

I have done a lot of trial and errors in translating design to code.

### Continued development

I'll continue on thinking on how I could best translate a design mockup to code.
